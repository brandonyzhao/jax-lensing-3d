# jax-lensing-3d
A package for 3D dark matter mass mapping in JAX

This repository contains scripts to reproduce results from the following paper: 

[Revealing the 3D Cosmic Web through Gravitationally-Lensed Neural Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15262), B. Zhao, A. Levis, L. Connor, P.P. Srinivasan, K.L. Bouman ICLR, 2025.

This package uses some functions from [jax-lensing](https://github.com/CosmoStat/jax-lensing), please see their repository for installation instructions. 

To run a simulated recovery with either kinematic or traditional weak lensing requirements on the volume from the paper, please see either one of the shell scripts.
